## Overview

Jinn (Arabic: جن, also romanized as Djinn) are supernatural beings in pre-Islamic Arabian religious traditions and Islamic theology. According to Islamic belief, God created three sapient beings:

- **Angels** — from light
- **Humans** — from clay
- **Jinn** — from smokeless fire

Unlike angels who are bound to obey God, jinn possess free will and can choose between good and evil. They live in a parallel world normally invisible to humans, can take various forms, and have their own societies, religions, and hierarchies.

The Quran contains an entire chapter dedicated to them (Surah Al-Jinn, Chapter 72), and belief in jinn remains strong across the Muslim world today.
