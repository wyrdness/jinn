According to Islamic belief, God created three sapient beings: angels from light, humans from clay, and jinn from smokeless fire (or 'scorching fire'). Unlike angels who are bound to obey God, jinn possess free will and can choose between good and evil. They live in a parallel world invisible to humans, can take various forms, and have their own societies, religions, and hierarchies. The Quran contains an entire chapter (Surah Al-Jinn) dedicated to them. Belief in jinn remains strong across the Muslim world, with encounters and possessions still reported."
